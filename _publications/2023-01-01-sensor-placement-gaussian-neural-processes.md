# excerpt: "This paper introduces a convolutional Gaussian neural process (ConvGNP) for improving environmental sensor placement in remote regions like Antarctica. By capturing non-stationary behavior and scaling to large datasets, ConvGNP outperforms traditional Gaussian processes, recommending more informative placements to enhance environmental monitoring and digital twin systems."
