excerpt: 'This study uses unsupervised classification to identify coherent ozone regimes from UKESM1 model data. Gaussian mixture modeling reveals six global classes and highlights shifts in ozone distribution under future climate scenarios, including expanded tropical regimes and signs of ozone hole recovery.'
