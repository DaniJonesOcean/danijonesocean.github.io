excerpt: 'This study explores the role of surface heat fluxes in shaping the stratification of subantarctic mode waters in the Southern Ocean, which are key to global heat and carbon uptake. Using sensitivity studies in an ocean state estimate, the research reveals a two-phase response: an initial decrease in stratification due to heat loss, followed by a delayed increase driven by atmospheric damping and salinity changes.'
