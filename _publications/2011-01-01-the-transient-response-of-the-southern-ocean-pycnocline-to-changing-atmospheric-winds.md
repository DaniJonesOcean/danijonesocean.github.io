**Abstract**:

The vertical density structure of the Southern Ocean is dynamically linked to wind stress at the surface, but the nature of this coupling is not fully understood. Observations from the last several decades show a significant increase in the strength of westerly winds over the Southern Ocean, but an appreciable change in the tilt of constant density surfaces (isopycnals) has not yet been detected there. Using a combination of theory and idealized numerical simulations, we show that the response of the density structure occurs on centennial timescales, making it difficult to detect significant changes with a few decades of hydrographic observations. Dynamic coupling between the circumpolar current and northern basins regulates the slow adjustment of the density structure. Our results provide a new interpretation for recent observations and highlight the importance of the interaction between regional Southern Ocean dynamics and global ocean circulation.
