**Abstract**:

This dataset is a multiyear mean Southern Ocean freshwater flux field that uses recently compiled measurements of ice sheet melting, iceberg calving, iceberg tracking, and river runoff. It has a horizontal resolution of 1/6° and uses BEDMAP2 for identifying and placing individual ice sheets. The aim of this work is to improve the representation of Antarctic freshwater input in Southern Ocean models.
