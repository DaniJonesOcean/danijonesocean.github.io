# excerpt: 'This study explores the impact of spatially varying meltwater fluxes on Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) properties and formation. Using a global ocean and sea-ice model, we show that non-uniform meltwater fluxes result in higher salinities in AABW compared to uniform fluxes. Additionally, we find that increases in ice sheet melting since 1958 can explain the observed freshening of AABW since 1990.'
